# my-php ~ MAN307 PHP Home Assignment

This repository contains a collection of home assignments for the MAN307 Business Programming course. In this course, you will learn about PHP programming and web development. To complete these assignments, you will need to set up a development environment using XAMPP and optionally, any other static Nginx or Apache server of your choice.

## Getting Started

To get started with these assignments, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install XAMPP

XAMPP is a popular development environment for PHP that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and other essential tools. You can download XAMPP from the [official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Step 2: Install a Static Nginx or Apache Server (Optional)

If you prefer to use a different web server such as Nginx or Apache, you can install it separately. Make sure to configure it to work with PHP.

### Step 3: Clone this Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arifgarayev/my-php.git
```

### Step 4: Navigate to the Assignment Folder

Navigate to the folder of the specific assignment you want to work on. For example:

```bash
cd $(pwd)/my-php
```

### Step 5: Start Developing

Start your development server (XAMPP or your chosen server) and work on the assignment using your preferred code editor.

## Assignment Structure

Each assignment is organized in its own folder or php file within this repository. The structure typically includes:

1. **Instructions**: A document or README that provides detailed instructions for the assignment.

2. **Starter Code**: If applicable, you may find some useful php code snippets.

## Final Project - `final-project`

The final project for this course is named `final-project`. This project is designed to test your understanding of PHP and web development concepts learned throughout the course. It will likely be more complex and comprehensive than the individual assignments.
